Rendering Engine’s Graphics Layer (ReGL) is a state-of-the-art game engine designed with
the primary goal of simplifying the complex process of creating visually stunning and highly interactive games.

The Rendering Engine part of ReGL signifies its core functionality. 
It is responsible for generating high-quality graphics in real-time, 
ensuring smooth and visually appealing gameplay. 
This engine is designed to handle the heavy lifting of game graphics, 
allowing game developers to focus on creating engaging content 
without worrying about the intricacies of graphics programming.

The Graphics Layer represents the abstraction layer of ReGL. 
It provides a simplified interface to OpenGL, 
making it easier for developers to leverage the power of 
hardware-accelerated graphics without getting entangled in the complexities of OpenGL. 
This layer handles tasks such as texture loading, shader compilation, 
and frame buffering, thereby streamlining the game development process.

In essence, ReGL is not just a tool, but a comprehensive solution aimed at empowering 
game developers to bring their creative visions to life with ease and efficiency. 
Whether you’re an indie developer working on your first title or a seasoned professional 
looking to streamline your workflow, ReGL is designed to be your go-to resource for game development.
